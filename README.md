## Summary

Frontier exploration is driven by the need to send robots into environments that are hazardous, inaccessible, or simply uncharted by humans. These environments can range from space and deep-sea locations to disaster-stricken areas on Earth. The primary objectives of frontier exploration are to map the explored area, make informed decisions about where to explore next and adapt to dynamic and changing conditions.

## Formal Definition

Frontier exploration is a fundamental area within the field of autonomous robotics, primarily applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and mobile robots. It revolves around the task of autonomously navigating and mapping unknown environments to discover areas of interest or significance. The core concept of frontier exploration lies in the identification and systematic exploration of "frontiers," which are the unexplored boundaries between known and unknown spaces within the environment. These frontiers represent areas where the robot has incomplete or uncertain information about its surroundings and are typically associated with regions that could contain valuable information, obstacles, or points of interest. The primary goal of frontier exploration is to guide the robot efficiently through the environment, prioritizing frontiers for exploration to maximize information gain while adhering to constraints such as energy efficiency, collision avoidance, and computational resources.

Frontier exploration algorithms, such as ADD PAPER FROM REFERENCES, are designed to automate the process of identifying, planning paths to, and exploring these frontiers. They employ a combination of techniques, including sensor data analysis, path planning, and replanning strategies, to optimize the exploration process.

## Overview 

### Frontier Exploration Basics
1. **Defining Frontier Exploration:**
Frontier exploration is the systematic process by which robots identify, navigate to, and map the boundaries of unknown regions within an environment. These boundaries, known as "frontiers," represent the interface between explored and unexplored areas, where the robot lacks complete information. The primary objective is to intelligently prioritize frontiers for exploration, considering various constraints, to maximize information gain while optimizing robot resources.

2. **Key Components: Sensors and Mapping:**
Sensors play a fundamental role in frontier exploration. These can include LiDAR, cameras, depth sensors, and more, providing the robot with data about its surroundings. Simultaneously, mapping techniques like occupancy grid maps, Octomap, or SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enable the robot to construct and update maps of the explored area, helping it navigate effectively in real-time.

### Exploration Algorithms
1. **Coverage-Based Exploration:**
These algorithms prioritize visiting unexplored regions of the environment, ensuring that the robot systematically covers all areas. Algorithms like grid-based or spiral patterns help achieve even coverage.

2. **Information-Gain Exploration:**
These algorithms aim to maximize the robot's knowledge acquisition. They focus on regions that promise the most informative data, often guided by metrics like entropy or mutual information, which quantify the uncertainty or information content of unexplored areas.

3. **Frontier-Based Exploration:**
Frontier exploration algorithms target the frontiers, identifying and selecting frontiers that provide the most promising opportunities for exploration. The robot navigates to these frontiers, acquiring new information about the environment, such as obstacles, obstacles' characteristics, or points of interest.


### Decision-Making in Frontier Exploration
1. **The Role of Decision-Making:**
Decision-making in frontier exploration involves selecting the next best action or waypoint for the robot to explore. This process combines the robot's current knowledge, sensor data, and the exploration strategy to make informed choices.

### Efficiently explore unknown environments.
Frontier exploration algorithms have significantly improved the efficiency of robotic exploration by guiding robots to previously unvisited and informative regions. These methods allow robots to systematically cover large and complex spaces while minimizing redundant exploration. Efficient path planning and frontier detection techniques have led to faster and more resource-efficient exploration missions.

### Generate maps of the explored areas.
One of the primary outcomes of frontier exploration is the generation of detailed maps of the explored areas. Robots equipped with sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and depth sensors can build accurate three-dimensional maps of their surroundings. These maps provide valuable information for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and further analysis of the environment. Mapping techniques, such as occupancy grid mapping and OctoMap, have been employed to create high-resolution maps.


### Make informed decisions about which areas to explore next.
Frontier exploration algorithms empower robots to make informed decisions about where to explore next. By assessing the uncertainty of an area, the presence of obstacles, and the potential for new information gain, robots can prioritize frontiers and explore strategically. Markov decision processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning methods have been applied to optimize exploration policies, enabling robots to choose actions that maximize their understanding of the environment.

### Adapt to Dynamic and Changing Environments:
Frontier exploration is not limited to static environments; it can adapt to dynamic changes. Robots equipped with sensors continually update their maps and exploration plans to accommodate dynamic obstacles, moving objects, or changing environmental conditions. This adaptability ensures that exploration missions remain effective in scenarios where the environment is not static.

These sensors provide rich data for terrain mapping, obstacle detection, and 3D modeling, enabling robots to navigate safely and adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. Additionally, robust perception algorithms have emerged to address challenges like lighting variations and unexpected obstacles, ensuring reliable and real-time decision-making during exploration missions.

### Real-World Applications: 
Frontier exploration has transitioned from theoretical research to practical applications. Robots equipped with frontier exploration capabilities are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as search and rescue operations, precision agriculture, and infrastructure inspection. These applications demonstrate the field's impact on addressing critical challenges and improving decision support in domains where efficient exploration and mapping are essential.

### Scalability and Adaptability: 
Frontier exploration approaches have showcased scalability and adaptability to various environmental conditions and terrains. Robots equipped with frontier exploration algorithms can efficiently explore both small indoor environments and large-scale outdoor areas, making them versatile tools for a wide range of applications. Researchers continue to refine these methods to address increasingly complex scenarios, enabling robots to explore with greater autonomy and reliability.


## Relationship to Decision-Making in Robotics

Frontier exploration in robotics is closely related to decision-making processes, often leveraging sophisticated techniques like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize robot actions in unknown environments. MDPs provide a formal framework for modelling decision-making problems under uncertainty, making them well-suited for frontier exploration scenarios. In this context, the robot faces a series of decisions about where to explore next while maximizing certain objectives, such as information gain or coverage. Each action, such as moving to a new location or adjusting sensors, is associated with a reward or cost, and the robot aims to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool within frontier exploration, allowing robots to learn optimal decision policies through interactions with the environment. For example, consider an autonomous rover tasked with exploring a Martian landscape. By employing RL algorithms, the rover can learn how to choose actions (e.g., moving to a particular area) that lead to discovering interesting geological features or potential signs of past life. Through a trial-and-error process, the robot learns which regions are worth exploring, balancing between exploring new frontiers and exploiting existing knowledge.

One example is Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), which have been applied to robotic exploration tasks. In these scenarios, the robot collects data about its environment and uses it to update its knowledge about the state of the world. This process helps the robot make more informed decisions about where to explore next. In a frontier exploration context, RL algorithms can help robots adapt to changing environments, optimize resource allocation (e.g., energy consumption), and navigate complex, dynamic spaces efficiently.

Space Exploration with Rovers: When rovers are deployed on planetary missions, such as NASA's Mars rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance, they rely on frontier exploration techniques for decision-making. These rovers explore the Martian surface, seeking to gather scientific data and images of interesting geological features. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) play a crucial role in planning the rover's movements. States include information about the rover's current location, power levels, instrument statuses, and environmental conditions. Actions involve selecting directions to drive and instruments to use. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can help rovers adapt to unexpected discoveries. For instance, if the rover encounters a potentially habitable environment or discovers unexpected minerals, it can receive rewards for further investigation. Over time, RL algorithms enable the rover to learn to prioritize regions with higher scientific value.

Search and Rescue Drones: In search and rescue missions, drones are deployed to locate and assist people in disaster-stricken or remote areas. These drones often employ frontier exploration strategies to efficiently cover large and uncertain environments. MDPs guide decision-making by considering factors such as drone battery levels, communication signal strength, and terrain complexity. Actions might involve changing altitude, speed, or search patterns. RL techniques can improve the drones' performance over time. For instance, if a drone finds a survivor, it can receive a reward for successfully identifying and reporting the location. RL allows the drone to learn optimal search patterns, prioritize areas with higher chances of finding survivors, and adapt to changing conditions like wind or obstacles.


## Variants

Frontier exploration is a versatile field, and there are several variants and extensions of the basic frontier exploration concept. Here's a brief overview of some notable variants:

1. **Multi-Robot Exploration:** 
In scenarios involving multiple robots or drones, the coordination and collaboration of robots become crucial.

Robots continuously update their maps and exploration plans to account for dynamic obstacles or evolving environmental conditions, ensuring effective exploration even in volatile settings.

3. **Time-Optimal Frontier Exploration:** Optimizing exploration considering limited resources.
Time-optimized exploration aims to minimize the time required to explore an environment fully. This variant considers factors like robot speed, battery life, and the urgency of exploration. Algorithms in this category focus on planning paths that allow robots to explore as much as possible in a limited time frame, which is valuable in time-sensitive applications like search and rescue.

4. **Dynamic environment Frontier Exploration:** 
In dynamic environments where objects or obstacles can move or change over time, dynamic frontier exploration adapts to these changes. Robots continuously update their maps and exploration plans to account for dynamic obstacles or evolving environmental conditions, ensuring effective exploration even in volatile settings.

5. **Human-Robot Collaboration in Frontier Exploration:** 
This variant emphasizes the collaboration between robots and human operators. Robots assist humans in exploring unknown or hazardous environments by autonomously identifying frontiers and suggesting points of interest for further investigation. Human inputs, preferences, or high-level directives can guide robot exploration.

6. **Sparse Frontier Exploration:**
Sparse exploration focuses on identifying and exploring only the most valuable or informative frontiers, rather than exhaustively covering the entire environment. By prioritizing regions with higher uncertainty or relevance, robots can optimize their exploration efforts in applications like scientific data collection.


7. **Adaptive Frontier Exploration:**
Adaptive exploration techniques enable robots to adjust their exploration strategies based on real-time feedback and changing mission objectives. Machine learning and adaptive control methods play a role in helping robots learn and adapt their exploration behaviours over time.
